# R Package Checker

This project automates the process of checking packages used in other R projects to determine which packages are necessary and which can be safely deleted. It simplifies the task of optimizing package dependencies in your R codebase.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. 


### Prerequisites

R code, which can run successfully. 


## Limitations
This package checker assumes that the provided R project code can successfully run. It also cannot check if a package might be installed as part of a different package.
